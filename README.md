This project is the teacher front-end for Quizdini 2.0

## To-Do List

* Create rough drawing of a MatchGameCreator

## React Router

This project uses the React Router module, installed via `npm install react-router-dom` 

Documentation can be found at [React Router: Declarative Routing for React.js](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

## Formik

I am going to try to use Formik in this project to simplify the gnarly aspects of creating dynamic forms in React

To install: `npm i formik`
